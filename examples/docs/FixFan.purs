  <h3>The anatomy of a Wags graph</h3>
  <p>
    In the <a @hwLink@ style="cursor:pointer;">hello world</a> section, we saw how to create and wire up two audio nodes: a <code>sinOsc</code>, or a sine-wave oscillator, is hooked up to a <code>gain</code> node. For some cases, feeding one audio node to another all the way up to a loudspeaker will be all you need. However, in most cases, you'll need to exploit three additional relationships:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="font-weight:800px;">Many to one</span>, where many audio units pass through one.</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight:800px;">One to many</span>, where a single audio unit passes through many different ones.</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight:800px;">Feedback</span>, where an audio unit is an input to itself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This section will show how wags handles all three cases:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="font-weight:800px;">~</span> or a squiggly or tilde, is the operation we'll use to send many audio units into one.</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight:800px;"><code>fan</code></span> is a function that we'll use to "fan" one audio node out to many.</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight:800px;"><code>fix</code></span> is the function we'll use to make an audio unit an input into itself.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The setup</h2>
    <p>
      To illustrate how <code>~</code>, <code>fan</code> and <code>fix</code> work, we're going to use three new audio units.
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>delay</code>: A delay node</li>
        <li><code>bandpass</code>: A bandpass filter, meaning a filter that lets a single frequency band pass through.</li>
        <li><code>loopBuf</code>: Looped playback of a buffer. We'll use an MP3 file from freesound.org.</li>
      </ul>
  <h2>Squiggle, or tilde, or <code>~</code></h2>

  <p>To send several audio units through one, we use the tilde to chain the units together.</p>

  <pre><code></code></pre>

  <h2>Fan</h2>

  <p><span style="font-weight:800;">Fan</span> takes an audio signal and fans it out to multiple processing chains. For example, if you have a looping buffer and you'd like to filter it through a bank of different filters, you can do this via fan. Fan takes two arguments:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The node to fan out.</li>
    <li>A function that accepts a reference to this node and returns a new node that contains the input <i>at least</i> once.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Let's see an example below that fans one <code>loopBuf</code> to five bandpass filters.</p>

  <pre><code></code></pre>

  <blockquote>The second argument to <code>fan</code> accepts a reference to the first node, <i>not</i> the node itself. To use this reference, you need to use the <code>input</code> function.</blockquote>

  <p>Just for kicks, let's jack it up to forty bandpass filters. Because we're using PureScript, we have the full power of its functional syntax to do our bidding.</p>

  <pre><code></code></pre>

  <h2>Fix</h2>

  <p><span style="font-weight:800;">Fix</span> is a fixed point operator. It accepts as an argument of type <code>Input p c</code> representing itself and returns... itself ðŸ¤¯. Like with <code>fan</code>, you'll need to use <code>input</code> to get an audio node out of the input. You use <code>fix</code> to create feedback!</p>

  <pre><code></code></pre>

  <blockquote>If you don't have some sort of delay line in your processing chain, either the WebAudio-provided delay line or a custom delay node, Web Audio will raise a runtime error. Wags doesn't check for this, so make sure you test your audio to guarantee that it's feedback-explosion-free!</blockquote>

  <h2>Next steps</h2>
  <p>In this section, saw how to combine together audio nodes with squiggles, fan one audio node to many processing chains via <code>fan</code>, and how to create a fixed point, aka feedback, for a node via <code>fix</code>. In the next section, we'll ramp up on all of the yummy <a @next@ style="cursor:pointer;">audio nodes you can use</a>.</p>
