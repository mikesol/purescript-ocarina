  <h2>The unknown unknowns of web audio</h2>
  <p>
    As we saw in the last section on subgraphs, sometimes, you simply don't know how your audio will evolve. For example, if we are building a live coding environment and create a space where someone can basically do <i>anything</i>, working with anonymous audio nodes will not cut it. For example, imagine that they have two relatively unconnected parts of the audio graph and want to start creating cross-connections. With subgraphs, we can't pick apart the graph and say "take node X and connect it to node Y" as nodes don't have names.
  </p>

  <p>
    Tumult solves this problem. It is an entirely separate rendering engine from the one we've seen before that works via <i>diffing</i> two audio graphs and adjusting the current graph based on the diff. The biggest difference is that tumult <i>requires</i> you to give a name to each audio unit. Otherwise, the engine won't know what node corresponds to what name.
  </p>

  <p>
    For you veteran coders and audio-ers, you may bristle at the word <i>diff</i>. After all, diffing is expensive, and we are working in resource constrained environments where timing is of the essence. Fear not! Tumult uses PureScript <code>Set</code>-s to do blazingly fast diffs. That said, tumult is the slowest part of ocarina (meaning it is just blazingly fast instead of obscenely and indecently fast), so only use it where you can afford a performmance hit.
  </p>

  <h2>Hello tumult</h2>

  <h2>Stability in tumult</h2>

  <p>While tumult will run a diff every time its event is triggered, if you don't tear down a node, its nodes will merrily putter along with whatever events you send them. This means that you can trigger tumult events <i>only</i> when you need to change the shape of the graph.</p>

  <h2>Feeling lucky</h2>

  <p>So far, we have only seen the <code>DiffMe</code> instruction sent to tumult. There is another instruction you can send called <code>FeelingLucky</code>. <code>FeelingLucky</code> will attempt to perform its instruction and be a no-op if it is incoherent with respect to the graph. Careful with this, though! <code>DiffMe</code> guarantees that whatever you send to tumult will be what's rendered from your loudspeaker. Too many <code>FeelingLucky</code>-s, on the other hand, can lead to bugs where you're not quite sure anymore <i>what</i> is playing. That said, <code>FeelingLucky</code> is grotesquely fast, especially for larger graphs. So if it makes sense to use it, use it!</p>

  <h2>Next steps</h2>
  <p>In this section, we learned how to use tumult to create truly dynamic audio graphs that allow you to fine-tune the speed-versus-dynamism tradeoff in various ways.</p>
  <p>In the next section, we'll look at how to create audio graphs via an <a ~next~ style="cursor:pointer;">imperative API that more closely resembles Web Audio while providing additional type-safety benefits</a>.</p>
