  <h1>Audio Worklets</h1>

  <h2>Supercharging our audio experiences</h2>

  <p>The Web Audio lets you do basically anything, but when anything isn't enough, there are custom Audio Worklets. </p>

  <p>Custom audio worklets come in a few shapes an sizes:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>You can <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/audio-worklet/">write your own in JavaScript</a>. While this is ok for small PoCs, it will get really slow really quick.</li>
    <li>You can compile your favorite C/C++/Rust audio processors to <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/audio-worklet-design-pattern/#using-audio-worklet-with-webassembly">web assembly</a>. The helpful folks at Google have created many examples that do exactly this, and you can pilfer them for fun and profit.</li>
    <li>My go-to solution is Faust. <a href="https://faust.grame.fr/">Faust</a> is the greatest audio project on Earth, and let's you build very performant audio processors with an expressive and concise syntax. Faust's <a href="https://webaudioconf.com/posts/2017_EA_60/">Web Audio integration</a> is a one-liner from the command line.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In this example, we'll use Faust to create a three custom audio units and wire them together using Ocarina. The units are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A wicked sawtooth synth.</li>
    <li>A kickin' comb filter.</li>
    <li>Freeverb, the free-software-world's favorite reverb!</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Faust</h2>

  <p>Here are our three faust examples:</p>

  <h3>Sawtooth</h3>

  <h3>Comb filter</h3>

  <h3>Freeverb</h3>

  <h3>Compilation</h3>

  We can compile each example using the following commands. Each command creates a self-contained JavaScript file, so all we need to do is link to it in ocarina-land.

  <pre><code>placeholder</code></pre>

  <h2>Ocarina</h2>

  <p>Ocarina provides a type-safe interface for declaring the API of Audio Worklets. While it's your job to make sure the API is in fact the actual API of the worklet, assuming this is correct, ocarina will enforce it for you. Let's see how in the following example. Here's the code:</p>

  <pre><code>placeholder</code></pre>

  <p>And here's the result:</p>

  <blockquote>placeholder</blockquote>

  <p>You can try it yourself by <a>following this trypurescript link.</a></p>

  <h3>The API contract</h3>

  <p>The <code>InitializeAudioWorklet</code> API contract is defined like so:</p>

  <pre><code>InitializeAudioWorkletNode
  { name :: Proxy name
  , numberOfInputs :: numberOfInputs
  , numberOfOutputs :: numberOfOutputs
  , outputChannelCount :: outputChannelCount
  , parameterData :: { | parameterData }
  , processorOptions :: { | processorOptions }
  }</code></pre>

  <p>And here is how the APIs parameters are used:</p>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Parameter</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>name</code></td>
      <td>The name of the worklet as defined in the JS output. When in doubt, check the JS produced by faust!</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>numerOfInputs</code></td>
      <td>How many inputs does the node take? Note that this is <i>not</i> the number of channels, but rather the number of distinct inputs, like in a merger node.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>numerOfOutputs</code></td>
      <td>How many outputs does the node produce? Note that this is <i>not</i> the number of channels, but rather the number of distinct outputs, like in a splitter node.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>outputChannelCount</code></td>
      <td>How many channels are in each output? This is defined using a tuple of type-level numbers.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>parameterData</code></td>
      <td>Initial parameters for the audio node. This will also define what parameters can be sent to it via events (the record gets flipped to a <a href="https://github.com/natefaubion/purescript-variant"><code>Variant</code></a> when it is an event).</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h2>Next steps</h2>
  <p>In this section, we created three audio worklet nodes using Faust and used them in the Web Audio API via ocarina. There is active work going on to bundle all this into a single toolchain so that Faust can be written directly in PureScript and automatically read as an Audio Worklet by ocarina. Until that happens, though, this is a great solution: just make sure to get the parameter names right across the language barrier! No amonut of type-safety can save you there ðŸ˜…</p>
  <p>In the next section, we'll look at how to create <a ~next~ style="cursor:pointer;">mutable state in a ocarina graph</a>.</p>
