-- | Run a scene.
-- |
-- | - `Event trigger` is the event to which the scene reacts. `trigger` will contain things like an initial event, mouse clicks, MIDI onsets, OSC commands and any other event to which the scene should respond.  Because of this, the polymorphic type `trigger` is often defined as an ADT with different potential incoming actions, similar to how [actions are defined in Halogen](https://github.com/purescript-halogen/purescript-halogen/blob/master/docs/guide/02-Introducing-Components.md#actions). Note that no sound will be produced unless there is _at least_ one event. For this reason, there is usually some form of initial event, ie `data Trigger = InitialEvent | MouseClick | etc..`, that is sent to start audio rendering. All of the examples in this repo contain an initial event, which is often `pure unit` in the case where there in _only_ the initial event.
-- | - `Behavior world` is the outside environment. `world` will usually contain things like the current mouse position, the ambient temperature, the axial tilt of the Earth, or other things that can be modeled as a continuous function of time. One important thing to note is that `world` _lags_ `trigger` by 0 or 1 events in the [browser event queue](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop). For most real-world applications, this does not matter, but it does lead to subtle logic bugs if `trigger` and `world` are corrolated. For this reason, it is good to decouple `trigger` and `world`.
-- | - `EngineInfo` is the engine information needed for rendering.
-- | - `FFIAudio` is the audio state needed for rendering
-- | - `Scene` is the scene to render. See `SceneI` to understand how `trigger` and `world` are blended into the inptu environment going to `Scene`.

-- | The information provided to `run` that tells the engine how to make certain rendering tradeoffs.
type EngineInfo
  = { easingAlgorithm :: EasingAlgorithm }

-- | An algorithm that tells the engine how much lookahead the audio should have in milliseconds. The `(->) Int` is a penalty function, where a positive input is the number of milliseconds left over after rendering (meaning we gave too much headroom) and a negative input is the number of milliseconds by which we missed the deadline (meaning there was not enough headroom). This allows the algorithm to make adjustments if necessary.
-- |
-- | As an example:
-- |
-- | ```purescript
-- | easingAlgorithm :: EasingAlgorithm
-- | easingAlgorithm =
-- |   let
-- |     fOf initialTime = mkCofree initialTime \adj -> fOf $ max 20 (initialTime - adj)
-- |   in
-- |     fOf 20
-- | ```
-- |
-- | This easing algorithm always provides at least 20ms of headroom to the algorithm, but adjusts upwards in case deadlines are being missed.
type EasingAlgorithm
  = Cofree ((->) Int) Int

-- | The output of `run` to be consumed downstream (or not). It contains:
-- | - `nodes`: the nodes in the audio graph including information about things like their frequency, Q value, on/off state etc.
-- | - `edges`: incoming edges into nodes.
-- | - `res`: the residual from the computation.
-- |
-- | This information can be used for visualizing the audio graph or for other instruments outside of a browser that are using the browser as a control layer.
type Run res
  = { nodes :: M.Map String AnAudioUnit
    , edges :: M.Map String (Set String)
    , res :: res
    }

-- | The input type to a scene that is handled by `run`. Given `Event trigger` and `Behavior world`, the scene will receive:
-- |
-- | `trigger` - the trigger.
-- | `world` - the world.
-- | `time` - the time of the audio context.
-- | `sysTime` - the time provided by `new Date().getTime()`
-- | `active` - whether this event was caused by a trigger or is a measurement of the world. This is useful to not repeat onsets from the trigger.
-- | `headroom` - the amount of lookahead time. If you are programming a precise rhythmic event and need the onset to occur at a specific moment, you can use `headroom` to determine if the apex should happen now or later.
type SceneI trigger world
  = { trigger :: trigger
    , world :: world
    , time :: Number
    , sysTime :: Instant
    , active :: Boolean
    , headroom :: Int
    }

-- | Given a buffering window and an event, return a list of events that occur within that window.
-- | - `timeToCollect` - the buffering window
-- | - `incomingEvent` - the event to buffer
-- |
-- | For example, if `event` outputs the following sequence:
-- |
-- | - `unit` @ 0 ms
-- | - `unit` @ 1 ms
-- | - `unit` @ 7 ms
-- | - `unit` @ 9 ms
-- | - `unit` @ 15 ms
-- |
-- | Then:
-- |
-- | ```purescript
-- | bufferToList 4 event
-- | ```
-- |
-- | would group together events within the same 4ms window before emitting them, resulting in
-- |
-- | ```purescript
-- | { time :: 0ms, value :: unit } : { time :: 1ms, value :: unit } : Nil -- emitted at 4ms
-- | { time :: 7ms, value :: unit } : { time :: 9ms, value :: unit } : Nil -- emitted at 11ms
-- | { time :: 15ms, value :: unit } : Nil -- emitted at 19ms
-- | ```
