-- | These functions uses the `GraphIsRenderable` typeclass to assert that an audio graph is renderable by the web audio engine. This means, amongst other things, that it has a unique output device (ie speaker), that it does not have any dangling units not connected to a loudspeaker, etc.

-- | Loops audio.
-- |
-- | In WAGS, a "loop" is a universe whose `changeBit` increments by 1. That means that the structure of the graph is similar (no units added, none taken away) while some or none of its internal content (ie frequencies, gains, etc) has changed. This is accomplished using the `change` family of functions in `WAGS.Change`.

-- |   WAGS.do
-- |     start -- initial frame
-- |     { time } <- env
-- |     create (scene time) $> Right unit
-- |     @> loop -- we loop by changing the scene based on `time` in the `env`
