-- | Move an edge in an edge list for a given node.
-- | As an example, if we have a gain node with incoming edges `7,8,9`, this can be used to move `7`
-- | to the end of the list so that we have `8,9,7`.
-- | This is useful in conjunction with rebasing if two graphs are almost similar save their
-- | edge lists, which have a different order.
-- |
-- | `at` - a ptr to the node whose edges we will move
-- | `from` - the edge we are moving - either an index (`Nat`) or audio unit ref
-- | `to` - the new position in the list
-- | `i` - the input universe
-- | `o` - the output universe
