  <h3>A web-audio framework written in PureScript</h3>

  <p>Hi! You've found <a href="https://github.com/mikesol/purescript-wags">Wags</a>.</p>

  <p>Wags is a web-audio framework designed for interactive media and games. Events like mouse clicks, MIDI notes and tweening frames are streamed to an audio rendering engine and, in response to these events, sound happens.</p>

  <h2>Why?</h2>

  <p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API">Web Audio API</a> is an amazing piece of technology. It is clear, concise, straightforward and ergonomic. So why build a framework on top of it?</p>

  <p>As audio projects become more and more ambitious, a need emerges for powerful abstractions to handle browser events and scheduling. Wags tackles this problem through a small set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming">FRP</a>-based abstractions. In doing so, it aims to be concise, expressive, and as fast as manually-optimized hand-written JavaScript.</p>

  <h2>How does it sound?</h2>

  <p>Here's a small example in Wags that, when you turn it on, emits a single sound and then uses feedback loops to create long tail. You can use the slider to change the properties of the tail in real time.</p>

  ~ex~

  <p>By the end of this documentation, you'll know all of the concepts you need to create interactive audio like the example above.</p>

  <p>If you'd like to use this documentation as a springboard for your own work, it can be found <a href="https://github.com/mikesol/purescript-wags/tree/main/examples/docs">here</a>.</p>

  <p>And now, without further ado, let's write a small <a ~next~ style="cursor:pointer;">hello world Ã  la wags</a>!</p>
